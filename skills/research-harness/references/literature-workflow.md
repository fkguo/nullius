## Literature Research Gate

For physics or adjacent scientific literature research routed through `hep-mcp`, citation graph checks are mandatory workflow steps, not optional keyword triggers.

Web search may be used first or in parallel to discover candidate papers, non-indexed materials, experimental pages, proceedings, code, or broader context. Before making literature-map claims, normalize core candidate papers to stable identifiers such as INSPIRE recid, arXiv id, DOI, or OpenAlex id and use `hep-mcp` provider tools for citation graph authority.

Minimum expectations:

- Treat `50` as a default page/initial-batch size, not a completion threshold. Literature work is complete only after a saturation artifact records provider coverage, candidate-pool rationale, and citation/reference graph checks.
- For each seed or core paper, check both directions when relevant: papers it references and papers citing it.
- For claims about paper relationships, source priority, review status, influence, or literature gaps, inspect the citation/reference graph with `hep-mcp` provider tools; do not rely only on search snippets or web pages.
- For writing-facing work, resolve citekeys and BibTeX through `hep-mcp` provider tools rather than hand-maintaining citekey authority from web search.

Useful `hep-mcp` routes include:

- Resolve identifiers first through the available provider route: INSPIRE recid, arXiv id, DOI, or OpenAlex id.
- INSPIRE citation/reference graph when covered: `inspire_literature(mode=get_references, recid=...)` and `inspire_literature(mode=get_citations, recid=..., sort=...)`.
- Cross-paper graph inside the provider layer: `inspire_find_connections` or `inspire_network_analysis`.
- arXiv/source checks: use arXiv/provider routes for preprints, versions, and source text when the task depends on the actual paper source.
- OpenAlex/cross-domain checks: use OpenAlex/provider routes when the paper is outside clean INSPIRE coverage or when broader cross-field citations may matter.
- Citekeys and BibTeX for cited recids: `inspire_resolve_citekey`; batch identifier-to-recid mapping written into the project: `hep_inspire_resolve_identifiers` with `project_root` and an `output_dir` under the current run directory (e.g. `artifacts/runs/<run_id>/literature`).

If `hep-mcp` or a needed provider is unavailable, state that limitation explicitly and do not present the citation graph as complete.
