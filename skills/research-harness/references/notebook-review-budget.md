# Notebook content review: material, storage and budget

Valid UTF-8 text remains text regardless of size; Markdown links are discovered
recursively. Binary or invalid UTF-8 linked files are immutable `opaque_links`
snapshots and hash locators, not read evidence. Every opaque path/hash needs a
specific `opaque_sources` assessment; a required unread source prevents acceptance.
Notebook and explicit dependencies require strict UTF-8 and LF or CRLF endings.

The complete material is frozen before review. Storage (`--snapshot-bytes`,
default 512 MiB; `--max-files`, default 256) is separate from each request's
`--context-bytes` and configured backend `--context-tokens` window (default
200,000 tokens, with instruction/output reserves). Default request bytes use a
conservative token upper bound. A larger explicit byte packet requires captured
backend token usage when that bound exceeds the window; missing capacity evidence,
observed backend compaction or delivery failure supplies no acceptance.

Larger materials use original UTF-8 intervals with adjacent original context,
followed by a joint audit receiving the COMPLETE original notebook and text
dependencies. All intervals and the joint audit must be complete and fresh;
selected quotations or summaries cannot replace this original input. The default
execution budget is 1200 seconds and 64 calls (`--timeout-secs`, `--max-batches`),
with one attempt per call and no automatic retry. Shortfalls expose total frozen
material, pending intervals and joint scope, the reason and a resumable command.
An unfinished intake reports discovered material and incomplete dependency
enumeration. `--resume <run-id>` creates a new run, revalidates original receipts
and material identity, retains explicit dependencies and storage budgets, and
never rewrites old evidence. If the full joint input does not fit the backend,
raise an available backend's request budget or leave the review incomplete.
Only tool mode `none` is accepted. Multiple batches are one semantic review;
they do not establish independent confirmations or a cross-family quorum.
